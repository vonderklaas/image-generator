### Perceptron as a Linear Classifier

This repo contains a simple Python implementation of the **Perceptron algorithm**,
one of the earliest and most fundamental building blocks in machine learning. It classifies data into two categories
using a **straight line** (or hyperplane) based on input features.

### What Is a Perceptron?

A **Perceptron** is a mathematical model inspired by how a single neuron works in the brain.
It’s used for **binary classification** — deciding if an input belongs to class `0` or class `1`.

### Example Use Cases:
- Spam vs. not spam
- Yes vs. no
- Pass vs. fail
- Anything with two possible outcomes
